A step-by-step workshop to build a React application, all while learning React fundamentals. Best if accompanied with live facilitation by me ðŸ™‚.

## Exercises

All of the exercises make use of [ES.next](http://www.benmvp.com/learning-es6-series/), so you may need to brush up on the new JavaScript features if they are unfamiliar. Each step in the workshop builds on top of the previous one. If at any point you get stuck, you can find the answers in the source code of the current step. Any step can be used as a starting point to continue on to the remaining steps.

You can start at the [beginning](src/00-begin/) to get set up. Afterwards follow these steps:

1. [JSX](src/01-jsx/)
1. [Query Field](src/02-query-field/)
1. [API](src/03-api/)
1. [Lists](src/04-lists/)
1. [Form Submit](src/05-form-submit/)
1. [Components](src/06-components/)
1. [Prop Types](src/07-prop-types/)
1. [Custom Hook](src/08-custom-hook/)
1. [Loading States](src/09-loading-states/)
1. [Final Quiz](src/10-quizd/)

- Using JSX syntax ([Step 1](src/01-jsx/))
- Maintaining component state with `useState` hook ([Step 2](src/02-query-field/))
- Handling user interaction ([Step 2](src/02-query-field/))
- Making API calls with `useEffect` hook ([Step 3](src/03-api/))
- Rendering dynamic lists of data ([Step 4](src/04-lists/))
- Conditionally rendering components ([Step 4](src/04-lists/))
- Handling HTML forms & form elements ([Step 5](src/05-form-submit/))
- Writing readable, reusable and composable components ([Step 6](src/06-components/))
- Type-checking props ([Step 7](src/07-prop-types/))
- Factoring out logic from components into custom hooks ([Step 8](src/08-custom-hook/))
- Leveraging ES6+ to maintain application state with `useReducer` hook ([Step 9](src/09-loading-states/))
- Applying component styling with CSS classes (throughout)
