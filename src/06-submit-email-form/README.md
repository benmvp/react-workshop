# Step 6 - Submit email form

The goal of this step is to "send" the email and have it added to the email list by actually submitting the form.

As always, if you run into trouble with the [tasks](#tasks) or [exercises](#exercises), you can take a peek at the final [source code](./).

## Restart Setup

If you didn't successfully complete the previous step, you can jump right in by copying the step.

Ensure you're in the root folder of the repo:

```sh
cd react-workshop
```

Remove the existing workshop directory if you had previously started elsewhere:

```sh
rm -rf src/workshop
```

Copy the previous step as a starting point:

```sh
cp -r src/05-email-form src/workshop
```

Ensure [`src/index.js`](../index.js#L3) is still pointing to the `workshop` App:

```js
import App from './workshop/App';
```

Start the app:

```sh
# Yarn
yarn start

# ...or NPM
npm start
```

After the app is initially built, a new browser window should open up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and you should be able to continue on with the tasks below.

## Tasks

Add a submit button and an `onSubmit` handler to the `<form>` inside `EmailForm`:

```js
export default class EmailForm extends Component {
  // initialize state

  // other helper methods

  _handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let {from, to, subject, message} = this.state;

    console.log('submitting', {from, to, subject, message});
  }

  render() {
    let {from, to, subject, message} = this.state;

    return (
      <form className="email-form" onSubmit={this._handleSubmit}>
        {/* from, to, subject & message fields */}

        <footer>
          <button type="submit">Send email</button>
        </footer>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Add a required `onSubmit` prop to `EmailForm` and call it within `_handleSubmit` when all the fields are filled:

```js
export default class EmailForm extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    onSubmit: PropTypes.func.isRequired
  }

  // initialize state

  // other helper methods

  _handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let {from, to, subject, message} = this.state;

    // super simple validation
    if (from && to && subject && message) {
      // call handler with email info
      this.props.onSubmit({from, to, subject, message});
    } else {
      alert('fill out the form!');
    }
  }
}
```

Now when `App` handles `onSubmit` of `EmailForm` it will receive the form field values as a convient object instead of having to mess around with an `event` and having to pull data out of that. `EmailForm` takes care of dealing with the DOM (i.e. `e.preventDefault()`) so that the interface between it and its parent is clean.

After the form is submitted, also reset the form fields so that it's easy to send a new email:

```js
const DEFAULT_FORM_VALUES = {
  from: '',
  to: 'me@abcdef.com',
  subject: '',
  message: ''
};

export default class EmailForm extends Component {
  // prop types

  state = DEFAULT_FORM_VALUES

  // other helper methods

  _handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let {from, to, subject, message} = this.state;

    // super simple validation
    if (from && to && subject && message) {
      // call handler with email info
      this.props.onSubmit({from, to, subject, message});

      // reset the form to initial values
      this.setState(DEFAULT_FORM_VALUES);
    } else {
      alert('fill out the form!');
    }
  }
}
```

In the top-level `App` component, add a handler to `<EmailForm />` for its `onSubmit` prop and call it `_handleFormSubmit`. Just log the the new email to the console:

```js
export default class App extends Component {
  // initialize state

  // lifecycle methods

  // other helper methods

  _handleFormSubmit = (newEmail) => {
    // logging the email info generated by email form
    console.log(newEmail);
  }

  render() {
    let {selectedEmailId} = this.state;
    let selectedEmail = EMAILS.find(email => email.id === selectedEmailId);
    let emailViewComponent;

    if (selectedEmail) {
      emailViewComponent = (
        <EmailView
          email={selectedEmail}
          onClose={this._handleEmailViewClose}
        />
      );
    }

    return (
      <main className="app">
        <EmailList
          emails={EMAILS}
          onItemSelect={this._handleItemSelect}
        />
        {emailViewComponent}
        <EmailForm onSubmit={this._handleFormSubmit} />
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```

We would like for the newly added email to show up in the email list, but `<EmailList />` is rendering `EMAILS`, a constant list of emails. In order to be able to add newly created emails to the emal list, we need to maintain an array of emails in `state`. Create a new state property called `emails` and initialize it to the `EMAILS` constant:

```js
const EMAILS = [
  ...
];

export default class App extends Component {
  state = {
    // Initialize emails state to the `EMAILS` constant
    emails: EMAILS,
    // Initialize selected email ID to -1, indicating nothing is selected.
    // When an email is selected in EmailList, this will be updated to
    // corresponding ID
    selectedEmailId: -1
  }

  // helper methods

  // render()
}
```

> NOTE: Your first thought might be to update the `EMAILS` constant, but updating it will not cause React to call `render()` like calling `setState` does.

Now within `render()`, instead of rendering from `EMAILS`, we'll render from `this.state.emails`:

```js
const EMAILS = [
  ...
];

export default class App extends Component {
  state = {
    // Initialize emails state to the `EMAILS` constant
    emails: EMAILS,
    // Initialize selected email ID to -1, indicating nothing is selected.
    // When an email is selected in EmailList, this will be updated to
    // corresponding ID
    selectedEmailId: -1
  }

  // helper methods

  render() {
    // Also pull `emails` out from state
    let {emails, selectedEmailId} = this.state;
    let selectedEmail = emails.find(email => email.id === selectedEmailId);
    let emailViewComponent;

    if (selectedEmail) {
      emailViewComponent = (
        <EmailView
          email={selectedEmail}
          onClose={this._handleEmailViewClose}
        />
      );
    }

    return (
      <main className="app">
        <EmailList
          emails={emails}
          onItemSelect={this._handleItemSelect}
        />
        {emailViewComponent}
        <EmailForm onSubmit={this._handleFormSubmit} />
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```

Finally, back in `_handleFormSubmit`, change the console logging to update `this.state.emails` by prepending the `newEmail` to it, adding `id` to it:

```js
export default class App extends Component {
  state = {
    // Initialize emails state to the `EMAILS` constant
    emails: EMAILS,
    // Initialize selected email ID to -1, indicating nothing is selected.
    // When an email is selected in EmailList, this will be updated to
    // corresponding ID
    selectedEmailId: -1
  }

  // other helper methods

  _handleFormSubmit = (newEmail) => {
    this.setState(({emails}) => {
      // Create a full email info by spreading in `id`
      // Then spread to front of emails state (since it's the newest)
      let newEmails = [
        {
          ...newEmail,
          id: Date.now(),
        },
        ...emails
      ];

      // Set state with new updated emails list
      return {emails: newEmails};
    });
  }

  // render
```

> NOTE: You will notice that we're not calling [`.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) on the `emails` array, but instead making a copy of `emails` and inserting `newEmail` at the beginning of it all via the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Spread_in_array_literals). We **never** want to mutate `state` or the objects within it. Any time we need to update objects within `state` we use `setState` and make copies of the objects before changing them.

> NOTE: The [`setState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate) above differs from the ones we used to update `this.state.selectedEmailId`. Here we're using the "updater function" version. It takes a function that's passed the current version of the entire state and is expected to return new versions of whatever state needs to be updated. You need to use the "updater function" version of `setState` whenever the new state depends on the current state. We're appending a new email to the current emails list in order to return a new emails list. 

You should now see the email show up at the top of the list when you add it. You should also be able to click it and view its details. 

## Exercises

- Using the [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools#installation), watch how the new email item is optimally added to the list (nothing else in the UI is updated thanks to the [_reconciler_](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html) (aka "Virtual DOM"))
- Emails added via `EmailForm` do not have a date to display in `EmailView`. Update `_handleFormSubmit` to also pass along the current date/time as a string in the `date` property
