# Step 5 - Email Form

The goal of this step is learning how to deal with forms. HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. Regular HTML forms _do_ work in React, but in most cases, it's convenient to have React keep track of the data that the user has entered into a form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called ["controlled components"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

As always, if you run into trouble with the [tasks](#tasks) or [exercises](#exercises), you can take a peek at the final [source code](./).

## Concepts

- Handling HTML form elements

## Restart Setup

If you didn't successfully complete the previous step, you can jump right in by copying the step.

Ensure you're in the root folder of the repo:

```sh
cd react-workshop
```

Remove the existing workshop directory if you had previously started elsewhere:

```sh
rm -rf src/workshop
```

Copy the previous step as a starting point:

```sh
cp -r src/react/04-email-view src/workshop
```

Ensure [`src/index.js`](../index.js#L3) is still pointing to the `workshop` App:

```js
import App from './workshop/App';
```

Start the app:

```sh
# Yarn
yarn start

# ...or NPM
npm start
```

After the app is initially built, a new browser window should open up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and you should be able to continue on with the tasks below.

## Tasks

In `EmailForm`, create a form with **from** & **message** fields:

```js
export default class EmailForm extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form className="email-form">
        <fieldset>
          <label htmlFor="from">From:</label>
          <input type="email" id="from" defaultValue="" placeholder="jill@me.com" />
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
          <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
          <textarea id="message" defaultValue="" placeholder="[Insert message here]" />
        </fieldset>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice the use of `defaultValue` prop to set the initial value of the input fields instead of `value`, which is how you would normally initialize an HTML `<input>`. As of now, the DOM is maintaining the state of the input fields; React has no idea what the values of the fields are. They are currently ["uncontrolled components"](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html). We want to make them "controlled components" so we can keep track of their state within `EmailForm`.

> NOTE: If you were to set the `value` prop of the input fields, you wouldn't be able to type at all because setting `value` signals to React that you want React to control the values of the input fields.

Add new state properties for `from` & `message` and pass those state properties as the `value` of the corresponding input fields. Then `onChange` of the fields, update the corresponding state properties.

```js
export default class EmailForm extends Component {
  state = {
    from: '',
    message: ''
  }

  _updateFormFieldState = (name, e) => {
    this.setState({[name]: e.target.value});
  }

  _handleFromChanged = (e) => {
    this._updateFormFieldState('from', e);
  }

  _handleMessageChanged = (e) => {
    this._updateFormFieldState('message', e);
  }

  render() {
    let {from, message} = this.state;

    return (
      <form className="email-form">
        <fieldset>
          <label htmlFor="from">From:</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="from"
            value={from}
            placeholder="jill@me.com"
            onChange={this._handleFromChanged}
          />
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
          <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
          <textarea
            id="message"
            value={message}
            placeholder="[Insert message here]"
            onChange={this._handleMessageChanged}
          />
        </fieldset>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

When you using input fields you can take one of two approaches:

1. Set the `defaultValue` property to make the input an "uncontrolled" component. React doesn't control the value of the input. The browser maintains the value of the input
1. Set the `value` & `onChange` properties to make the input a "controlled" component. React **does** control the value of the input because you explicitly maintain its value in `state`. Every `onChange`, you update the state and reset its `value`.


## Exercises

- Use the [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools#installation) to watch the `state` of `EmailForm` update as you type into the fields
- Add **to** & **subject** form fields in between **from** & **message**
- **BONUS:** Get rid of the individual `_handle*Change` methods. Leveraging [`Function.prototype.bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind), call `this._updateFormFieldState` directly in the `onChange` handlers for each input to keep the code DRY.
