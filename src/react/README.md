# React FUNdamentals Workshop

A step-by-step workshop to build a React application, all while learning React fundamentals. Best if accompanied with live facilitation. ðŸ™‚

## Exercises

All of the exercises make use of [ES6](http://www.benmvp.com/learning-es6-series/), so you may need to brush up on the new JavaScript features if they are unfamiliar. Each step in the workshop builds on top of the previous one. If at any point you get stuck, you can find the answers in the source code of the current step. Any  step can be used as a starting point to continue on to the remaining steps.

You can start at the [beginning](00-begin/) to get setup. Afterwards follow these steps:

1. [JSX](01-jsx/)
1. [Components](02-components/)
1. [Lists](03-lists/)
1. [Email View](04-email-view/)
1. [Email Form](05-email-form/)
1. [Submit email form](06-submit-email-form/)
1. [Delete email](07-delete-email/)
1. [Interacting with APIs](08-api/)
1. [Styling](09-styling/)
1. [Mark unread/read](10-mark-unread/)
1. [Email Form Modal](11-email-form-modal/)
1. [API lib](12-api-lib/)
1. [Action-Reducers](13-action-reducers/)
1. [Redux-y Actions and Reducers](14-reduxy-actions-reducers/)
1. [Connect App and Store](15-connect-app-and-store/)
