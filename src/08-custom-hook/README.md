# Step 8 - Custom Hook

We've been able to greatly reduce the scope of the top-level `App` by breaking it down into several components. However, it still directly makes the API call in order to maintain the app-level state.

The goal of this step is to learn how to create our own custom hooks composed of the base hooks like `useState` & `useEffect`. This allows us to extract component logic into reusable functions.

As always, if you run into trouble with the [tasks](#tasks) or [exercises](#exercises), you can take a peek at the final [source code](./).

If you didn't successfully complete the previous step, you can jump right in by copying the step.

Complete the [setup instructions](../00-begin) if you have not yet followed them.

Ensure you're in the root folder of the repo:

```sh
cd react-workshop
```

Remove the existing workshop directory if you had previously started elsewhere:

```sh
rm -rf src/workshop
```

Copy the previous step as a starting point:

```sh
cp -r src/react/07-prop-types src/workshop
```

Ensure [`src/index.js`](../index.js#L3) is still pointing to the `workshop` App:

```js
import App from './workshop/App'
```

Start the app:

```sh
npm start
```

After the app is initially built, a new browser window should open up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and you should be able to continue on with the tasks below.

## Concepts

- Creating async custom hooks

## Tasks

Create a new file called `useGiphy.js` which will contain our custom hook that will take in search parameters, make an API call and return results:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { getResults } from './api'

const useGiphy = () => {
  return null
}

export default useGiphy
```

A custom hook is a normal JavaScript function whose name starts with `use*` and may call other hooks like `useState` & `useEffect`.

Copy over all the hooks-related code from `App.js` into `useGiphy.js`:

```js
const useGiphy = () => {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useState({})
  const [results, setResults] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchResults = async () => {
      try {
        const apiResponse = await getResults(searchParams)

        setResults(apiResponse.results)
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err)
      }
    }

    fetchResults()
  }, [searchParams])

  return [results, setSearchParams]
}
```

Back in `App` make use of `useGiphy`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import useGiphy from './useGiphy'
import Results from './Results'
import SearchForm from './SearchForm'

const App = () => {
  const [results, setSearchParams] = useGiphy()

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Giphy Search!</h1>

      <SearchForm
        onChange={setSearchParams}
        initialSearchQuery="friend"
        initialLimit={6}
      />
      <Results items={results} />
    </main>
  )
}

export default App
```

Now `useGiphy()` can easily be used w/in other components because all of the state management and side-effect API logic have been abstracted away.
